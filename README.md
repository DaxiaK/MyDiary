#MyDiary 

## Summary

I veray like Makoto Shinkai's (新海 誠) movies!  This project is just try to create  the app - "My Diary" in "your name." on Android. In this movie , "My Diary" is a important app between Taki(瀧) and Mitsuha(三葉) . As a fan, I think maybe I can implement this app. If you also like "your name.", please join me to finish the "My Diary" , let it be true.

This project will need :
* Android developer
* GUI designer
* Japanese/English translation 

This project is created again in 20161104.
Because  it have some my personal info in old git .
So if you already maek a star or fork ,  you can do it again , thanks!

## Why is only Android verison?

In fact , Android version is more difficult than iOS ,becaus this app is run on iOS in the movie. But I will only create Android version becasue:

1. I don't have any mac now :P 
2. Android's apk is easy to release.

so , maybe I will try to create iOS version after this app is running.
