#MyDiary 

## Summary

I like Makoto Shinkai's (新海 誠) movies very much! This project is just trying to create the app - "My Diary" in "your name." on Android. In this movie, "My Diary" is an important app between Taki(瀧) and Mitsuha(三葉). As a fan, I think maybe I can implement this app. If you also like "your name.", please join me to finish the "My Diary",and let it become real.

This project will need :
* Android developer
* GUI designer
* Japanese/English translation 

This project is created again in 2016-11-04. Because it have some my personal info in old git repository.

So if you have already a starred or forked the repo,  you can do it again, thanks :)

## Why is there only Android version?

In fact, Android version is more difficult than iOS, because this app is running on iOS in the movie. But I will only create the Android version for now because:

1. I don't have any mac now :P 
2. Android apk is easy to release.

so, maybe I will try to create an iOS version after this app is running.

Because DVD/BD aren't released yet, so the use case is made from my memory and network information. 
If you have any idea or find some functionality that I miss, you can tell me or update the use case in **/UML/MyDiary.mdj**  by [starUML](http://staruml.io/):
